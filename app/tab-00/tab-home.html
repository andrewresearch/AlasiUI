In this study we took up this challenge, looking to the very well established concepts of metacognition and reflection. We brought them together into a theoretical model within which we conceived of metacognition and reflection as both a set of similar features, and as a spectrum ranging from the unconscious inner-self through to the conscious external social self. This model was used as a foundation for the computational analysis of 6090 pieces of reflective writing authored by undergraduate students. We found that the theoretical model was useful in informing the computational analysis, which in turn was successful in categorising the reflective writing in terms of evidence of metacognitive activity. Both the model and the algorithms used demonstrated potential for further development, advancing the field of learning analytics and more specifically, the area of reflective writing analytics.</p></blockquote>
                <p></p>
                <p>Reflective writing for the paper was drawn from the writing of nearly 1000 students using <a href="http://reflect.goingok.com">GoingOK.com</a>. This student data has not been cleared for ethical use outside of a number of research projects at QUT, so is not available for investigation today. However, the same analysis can be performed on other reflective writing samples. A few publicly available samples are provided for demonstration purposes, or you can paste your own reflective writing into the text box and perform an analysis on that.</p>
                <p>We propose a conception of metacognition and reflection as a continuum (see figure 1) from the metacognition by the inner subconscious self to reflection by the external social self, and that when reflection is recorded in reflective writing, that writing may provide evidence of metacognitive activity. We also suggest that the activities of metacognition and reflection share some common features (see figure 2), and that these features may be detectable through the use of certain types of phrases in  reflective writing.</p>

Table 1 shows how we interpret the various features of the model shown in figure 2. The computational model works with phrases and these are tagged with phraseTags. Table 2 shows how these phrase tags relate to the model features, and Table 3 provides an overview as to which grammatical patterns are used in identifying these types of phrases.</p>
